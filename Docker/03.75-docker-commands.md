# Useful Docker Commands

- `docker` - primary command for interacting with docker
- `docker-compose` (windows) or `docker compose` (linux) used to interact with docker-compose files.
  - Docker compose allows all variables and arguments needed to run a contaitner to be saved in a file (docker-compose.yml), allowing easier editing and maintenance. you run `docker-compose` from the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file
- `docker ps`  - Shows running containers
- `docker ps -a` - Shows all running and stopped containers 
- `docker logs [container name]` shows console logs from container
- `docker logs [container name] -f` shows console logs with live update for container 

## Startup Container Using `docker-compose`
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate` starts a container, recreating it from the source image if it already exsits. 


## Advanced/Maintenance Commands
- `docker compose pull` downloads the container images in the compose file.
- `docker system prune -af` - Removes unused containers and images to free up disk space
- `docker exec -it [container name] powershell` allows you to enter the windows containers powershell prompt
- `docker exec -it [container name] cmd` allows you to enter the windows containers command prompt
- `docker exec -it [container name] /bin/bash` allows you to enter the linux containers powershell prompt

## Clearing Excess Docker Images
If you experience trouble pulling down new images and are having trouble removing those excess images, check out this [issue thread](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26873) and the [docker-ci-zap](https://github.com/moby/docker-ci-zap) tool.
